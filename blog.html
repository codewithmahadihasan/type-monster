          Difference between Localstorage and session storage
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The difference between session storage and local storage is that
            local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data is
            cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets
            created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions
            are valid for only one tab at a time.

          Difference between global local and block scope

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Global scope specifies that variables defined outside the block are
            visible up to end of the program. Local scope specifies that
            variables defined within the block are visible only in that block
            and invisible outside the block. Variables declared in a block or
            function (local) are accessible within that block and does not exist
            outside it.

          How does JavaScript's event loop work?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Event loop is a secret machenism of JavaScript through which
            JavaScript acts like a multi-threaded programming language
            externally despite being a single-threaded programming language. The
            event loop closely monitors the call stack and if the call stack is
            empty, sends the task from the event queue to the call stack to
            complete the execution.

          When get undefined in JavaScript ?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            If the value of the variable is not assigned. Get undefined when
            accessing an array element with an out of bounds index.when the
            value is empty.Undefined value primitive value is used when a
            variable has not been assigned a value. The standard clearly defines
            that you will receive undefined when accessing uninitialized
            variables, non-existing object properties, non-existing array
            elements, and alike.
